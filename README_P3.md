# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
## by Osazemen Oriakhi


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. The dataset can be found here https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv.

## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I discovered that borrower's APR have a positive relationship with lender yield. Also, I discovered that the 'current' loan status borrowed the highest original loan amount and the 'cancelled' loan status borrowed the lowest original loan mount. Therefore, it can be determined from the loan status the level of original loan amount borrowed. I also observed that loans with lower prosper scores had higher loan yield than loans with higher prosper scores.
Also I discovered that monthly loan payments has a positive relationship with original loan amount which infers that the higher the original loan amount, the higher the monthly loan payments. I also discovered that total prosper payments has a positive relationship with on time prosper payments.
For the multivariate analysis, I discovered that loans with lower prosper rating produced higher borrower APR and loan yield. Also, the borrowers that are home owners borrowed higher loan amount than those tht are not home owners for each employment status. I also discovered that, 'Part-time' employment status showed the steepest slope of the negative relationship between prosperscore and lender yield. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I would focus on the relationship between borrower's APR and lender yield and how prosper rating relates with the pair. I start by introducing the borrower's APR variable, the Lender Yield and the prosper rating variable. 
Afterward, I will display their individual distributions and plot the transformed scatterplots, relating the variables together. making use of labels and color palettes where necessary.
